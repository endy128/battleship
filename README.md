# Battleship
JavaScript battleships game build with Test Driven Development

Practicing TTD for the initial functions and logic. In this exercise I'm trying to get a basic AI to play against for a game of Battleships. So far the AI just picks random squares so the game is not hard to beat. In time I hope to refine the AI to make it more challenging by having it focus on a certain area once a hit is made until a ship is sunk.

I found the TDD process really rewarding after getting going, the resulting functions were much more bug-free than my previous coding sessions so I can see the true value in the process, which meant after each test pass I could easily move on!

Using some recursive methods for finding places for the ships to go when setting their placement automatically.
